# To-Do App

A minimal to-do list demonstrating DOM selection/manipulation, event handling (click + keyboard), event delegation, and persistence with `localStorage` in vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- Add tasks with the Add button or Enter key
- Toggle complete via checkbox (line-through style)
- Delete tasks
- Persists tasks to `localStorage` (auto-load on refresh)

## Run locally

- Open `index.html` in your browser, or on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Ayman Ismail\Desktop\Todo App"
start .\index.html
```

## Files

- `index.html` — Markup and app shell
- `style.css` — Minimal, clean styles with completed/hover states
- `script.js` — Add/complete/delete logic with event delegation
  and `localStorage` persistence
